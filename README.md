# Truck-Fleet-Manager

Our application propose **FMaaS** (Fleet Manager as a Service).

Our backend is able to compute the best path for your trucks in order to maximize profit and lower travelled distance.
We extensively use genetic algorithm to make it happen.

As for our backend, we use json-api and mongodb to manage our API's and your trucks data.
Our frontend is a web application based on the Ember framework. We use Google Maps API in order to display the datas on screen and Bootstrap beautify it.

**Project not completed** : nous souhaitons continuer (un peu) le d√©veloppement du projet

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (with Docker)

## Installation

Clone this repository with its submodules (Backend as Docker-Compose) recursively using :
* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/QuarkyUp/Truck-Fleet-Manager-Front/`

Update submodule
* `git submodule update --remote --recursive`

Change to the cloned repository using :
* `cd Truck-Fleet-Manager-Front`

Install dependencies :
* `npm install --only=dev`

## How to use

### Launch the backend
If you want the latest version of the docker submodule :
* `git submodule update --remote --recursive`

Start docker-compose which contains json-api, mongodb and finance microservice using :
* `cd Docker-compose/`
* `docker-compose up` (exit with _ctrl + c_)  

### Launch the frontend
Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) using :
* `ember start`

## How it works

### Genetic Algorithm
You won't have to deal with it directly, but for your information you can use our genetic algorithm API :
* `(http://localhost:1337/algogen?start=[city]&end=[city])`

You can use any city from this list for `start` and `end` values.
* `Bordeaux`
* `Lille`
* `Lyon`
* `Marseille`
* `Nantes`
* `Paris`
* `Toulouse `
